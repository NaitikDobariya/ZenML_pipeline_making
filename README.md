# ZenML Pipeline Making: Training Pipeline for MLOps Applications

## Project Overview

**ZenML Pipeline Making** demonstrates the creation of a specialized training pipeline using ZenML, focusing exclusively on the model training phase within an MLOps framework. This project showcases how to build and manage a robust pipeline for training machine learning models, optimizing the process for efficiency and scalability. The pipeline does the data cleaning, data preprocessing, and training.

## Tech Stack

- **ZenML**: Framework used for orchestrating and managing the training pipeline.
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementing pipeline components and model training logic.

## Future Work

- **Pipeline Extension**: Consider extending the pipeline to include additional stages, such as data preprocessing or model deployment.
- **Integration with Experiment Tracking**: Explore integration with experiment tracking tools to enhance monitoring and optimization capabilities.
- **Scalability Improvements**: Investigate ways to optimize the pipeline for large-scale training tasks.
